Lisandro Martínez bugs me a bit, he seems to think he’s really really tough and I think overcompensates for his size a bit, plus he’s pretty reckless / dirty (something i generally don’t like, or equate with toughness as a lot of people seem to…)

I remember watching Gabriel Jesus bully him when we played United and was quite amused by it

Edit 

https://youtube.com/shorts/DGDCa2BXUro?feature=share

This is what I mean: Jesus outmuscled him shoulder to shoulder, then sends him for a taxi - and for some reason the video is entitled “Lisandro Martínez bullies and destroys Gabrièl jesus”

I think maybe it’s the United fans that make me dislike him - there were also people posting ridiculous stats about him having the highest amount of aerial challenges won (out of a tiny, tiny sample size, and many were partly contested, ie headers at knee height etc) in an attempt to make it out like he’s one of the best CBs in the league aerially

Name a player other than Rudiger who was in the starting 11 who left and needed to be replaced.

Managers don't get 1-2 seasons to adapt. Especially not after spending **half a billion**. You don't spend that kind of money and get to say ""we need time to adapt"" while not being able to score a goal.",1,r/PremierLeague,Who’s having a worse season?

j9h6zkw,118h7ej,LostInThought2021,"What an absolutely horrible take. Try to at least disguise your petty bias.

Liverpool have no excuses? How about an aging team that played the most games in Europe last season? Owners that won’t invest in the team properly for god knows what reason. You talk about Chelsea dealing with a new owner, etc., but Liverpool is dealing with being in limbo because of owners who tried unsuccessfully to sell (and therefore neglected to rebuild the midfield), new attackers trying to get acquainted to both a new team and a new league, and massive changes in the front office including recruiting and the sporting director.

Chelsea have outspent everyone by a wide margin and went out and got every player they could plant their eyes on. They also went and got one of the most promising coaches in the league to manage the team. And where are they? 4 points behind Liverpool, who also have a game in hand on them, and at a 0 for GD for the season (Liverpool are +10). You can say Liverpool have fallen the farthest, and I wouldn’t disagree, but that doesn’t mean they’re having a worse season. And you mentioning Chelsea’s hopes with new signings is speculative and hasn’t paid off in the least thus far, so it’s irrelevant. If Liverpool win their next 2 games (which are games in hand compared to 4 of the top 6 currently), they will be in 6th, behind 5th-place Newcastle only on goal differential. If Chelsea win their next game (which is the one in hand they have compared to 4 of the top 6), they’ll still be 10th.

How on Earth can you honestly come to a sub of educated football fans and say Liverpool are easily having the worse season?",-1,r/PremierLeague,Who’s having a worse season?

j9lcfz2,118h7ej,PersonalityOk8690,"The trouble is people are looking at the spending and judging it on the now. Expectations with the money spent don't match the situation. Chelsea have changed the hierarchy at ALL levels, ownership, board,  talransfers, scouting and coaching.  It's mental to think that they'd be in that top 4 mix given the utter turmoil the club was in. The spending makes people forget that at one point there was serious doubt Chelsea would even see out the season.

It's not to say they're having a good season but put it into context - when they had their transfer ban what were peoples views of how they'd perform. Were looking at the spending and automatically assuming that they should win the title. The squad was a mess and to an extent still is - there's a lot needs offloading. Chelsea need to be judged at the end of next season, expectation is they won't qualify for Europe but the fact that they still exist and have built for a future means that post summer there should be a much better what they're about. Strangely all the issues at the minute have reversed, Chelsea defence is a huge strength but they can't score to save their lives. If they start scoring things look a lot better.

To contrast with Liverpool it looks awful as they'd outperformed Expectations to the point that it's become the norm. They'd made an ability to refresh the squad by making marquee sales. The last time they got the final pieces in play to tip them over the edge but the last big sale was Coutinho. They've not had chance to refresh the squad in the way that others have given their methodology. They're paying the price given that they lost one of their most underrated players in mane. I know he was a star but I think people underestimated how much he allowed others to do their thing. Couple that with a midfield that looks woefully outgunned and you're bound to see a huge issue. I'd say that they look like needing at least 2 others to slot in alongside Bellingham if they were to get him, and that looks to be slipping away more each week.

I think the balance of the team is spot on.

Grealish’s speciality is to run around the defender and then quickly change pace to make it look more clumsy. 
Kane’s favorite is going for a header and then ducking down at the last second so it looks like the defender is climbing over him. Effective, but a bit dangerous to an unsuspecting defender who’s momentum can take them head over heels.

Some other players are fouled a lot, but don’t win many free kicks based on reputation and being unconvincing at diving.

They’re not always boring to watch but I tuned into their game tonight and that first half, as an example of my point, wasn’t an entertaining contest at all. City just kept the ball, RB Leipzig had one shot right at the end of the half whilst City had done fuck all with the ball for 45 minutes. 

Sometimes they exude such ‘control’ of the ball that their games offer nothing in the way of excitement. 

I want to see box to box, end to end, fast play with intent and stuff actually happening.

City are average 64.4% possession this season, I don't know how you can say they're more direct than Prime Barca. Barca had wide strikers (Villa/Pedro/Henry) who would run in behind from wide positions constantly. City don't. 

Also, Pep changed his tactics about 18 months ago and abandoned the extreme high pressing. He now plays more conventionally and allows less opportunities for counter attacks.

j9ejsxw,117uahi,Browny413,"A very good and interesting question that I was asking myself after the news came out next week.

I boycotted the world cup in December and I really wanted to watch it and felt like I really missed out. But I stuck with my decision. I decided that if I thought it would be hypocritical to still watch and support Man Utd, then I wouldn't let my love of football to override my morals.

After thinking about it I decided I would still watch and support Man Utd, for the following reason. 

My primary issue with the world cup, and the main reason for my boycott, was the number of people who died during the construction of the stadiums and associated infstructure. I didn't feel like I could watch an event where thousands of people were reported to have died, for a single month long event, in good conscience. I remember reading the first report from amnesty (I think it was via the guardian), that over 1,000 people had died and that was only in 2016, I decided then that I wouldn't watch the event.

Whilst I respect the people who boycotted in order to protest the Qatar because of their human rights record and gay rights law, but that was a secondary concern for me. I watched the world cup in Russia who have a similar if not worse record of damaging polices.

Obviously Qatar, the country, are responsible for the deaths during the world cup and I will hold that against them. I would also lay it at the feet of FIFA. And I'm also disappointed that no high profile player, coach or country didn't boycott.",0,r/PremierLeague,"Manchester United fans who boycotted the World Cup on moral grounds, if Manchester United is purchased by Qataris, will you stick to your morals and boycott the club?",2023-02-21 10:03:55,0,good interesting question asking news came next week boycotted world cup december really wanted watch felt like really missed out stuck decision decided thought would hypocritical still watch support man utd let love football override moral thinking decided would still watch support man utd following reason primary issue world cup main reason boycott number people died construction stadium associated infstructure feel like could watch event thousand people reported died single month long event good conscience remember reading first report amnesty i think via guardian 1000 people died 2016 decided watch event whilst respect people boycotted order protest qatar human right record gay right law secondary concern me watched world cup russia similar worse record damaging police obviously qatar country responsible death world cup hold them would also lay foot fifa im also disappointed high profile player coach country boycott

The worst part of all of this is that Manchester United doesn’t need a sugar daddy. We don’t need to have dirty money poured into the club for us to succeed. We are hugely profitable, and all we need is not to be owned by parasites who treat the club and its good name as a cash machine.

That said, they'd never get another penny from me, so does that count as a boycott?

In all honesty the Qatari's, plus the Saudi's & Abu Dhabi should all fall the fit & proper test, but because money talks, they all pass.

In either circumstance, I would further lose the sense of camaraderie I feel whenever I encounter a fellow United fan, as I have little respect for the glory hunters who are happy to whore out a club that stands for so much to so many in exchange for some trophies.

Man United - Crazily overrating players both past and present. In the past, saying Bruno > KDB, De Gea is the best goalie in the world. Presently, Rashford should win player of the year, Bruno is better than Odegaard, Shaw is the best lb in the league.

Liverpool - Claiming European cups count for more than Domestic league titles just to suit their agenda as Liverpool have more European cups than United but fewer league titles.

j9in5zg,118medk,ManISureDoLoveJerma,"Assuming you mean Atleti: 
You're correct that they beat a Liverpool team. 'Best Liverpool team ever' though? Not quite. But let's talk about it:

In the first leg Liverpool played away and lost to an early goal. Fair enough. But one game is not enough to judge a team on....as they would prove by losing 3-0 to Watford later. I'm going to go ahead and assume we won't make the argument Watford>Liverpool>Atleti

(Atleti also then went on to not lose a single match in the entirety of the La Liga and win the next year of the competition. But that's beside the point)

But the 2nd leg is where it gets interesting. Liverpool score at 43', and then when extra time begins score another at 94', which would put them ahead of Atleti. But a lot of the reason for the following 3 goals can be attributed to the goalkeeper being Adrian instead of Alisson.

Barring all of that, look at Paisley and Shankly's time at Liverpool and you'll realize it's a lot more debatable whether this is their best team ever. Especially considering those same players in that game are the ones being critiqued for doing poorly recently. 

If you want to know why La Liga is called a farmer's league though, (Which I don't necessarily believe) it's because it's only had 3 different winners for 20 years. And two of those teams are the only ones to ever win a Champion's League/Euro Cup. England has 9 teams which have been 1st or 2nd for the cup, while Spain has had 4. This is just to show the sheer scale of domination these two clubs have had over the league and representation of La Liga internationally.",2,r/PremierLeague,"I’m a prem fan and people need to stop calling la liga a farmers league.

j9kkbt0,118wql6,sleepytoday,"My favourite mental gymnastics to justify a club’s behaviour was when Derby players Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett drove whilst drunk, and Lawrence crashed the car, breaking the leg of the passenger and team captain Richard Keogh.  The club fined the two drunk drivers 6 weeks’ wages but sacked Keogh (probably just because he was injured).  
  
Many Derby fans at the time felt that the club acted properly.  Apparently Keogh deserved the more severe punishment because he was team captain and should have known better.  Despite the fact that he was the only one who didn’t drive drunk.  The mental gymnastics to come to that conclusion and actually believe it are quite extraordinary!  
  
Keogh challenged his treatment in court and was eventually awarded £2.4m in damages because it was obvious to anyone with a brain that he was only fired for getting injured, which is not legal in the UK.  And the club couldn’t even claim it was based on disciplinary, as Lawrence and Bennett had committed worse offences but only received a fine.  
  
It was a championship club and off-field activity, but I felt it fit the spirit of OP’s question!",127,r/PremierLeague,What’s the funniest mental gymnastics you have seen from a fan to justify their teams results?,2023-02-22 17:38:07,1,favourite mental gymnastics justify club behaviour derby player tom lawrence mason bennett drove whilst drunk lawrence crashed car breaking leg passenger team captain richard keogh club fined two drunk driver 6 week wage sacked keogh probably injured many derby fan time felt club acted properly apparently keogh deserved severe punishment team captain known better despite fact one didnt drive drunk mental gymnastics come conclusion actually believe quite extraordinary keogh challenged treatment court eventually awarded 24m damage obvious anyone brain fired getting injured legal uk club couldnt even claim based disciplinary lawrence bennett committed worse offence received fine championship club offfield activity felt fit spirit ops question

As for following one of the best teams, if you look at my other comment I explained that I was just a kid picking at random, so obviously the bigger teams were more attractive. But that has grown into a genuine love for the club. And how would you know about what kind of connection I feel with the sport anyway?

j9it6dq,118rf87,notoriouszlatan,"I don't think any of them are getting sacked. If anything, Conte won't be here next season. 

Let's look at it with a deep dive:

##Klopp:

1. Liverpool's best success in the past few decades have come under him. 
2. Just last season they were in for a potential quadruple.
3. Injuries have played a big part. Also, the adaptability of new players.
4. They'll get out of UCL soon so they'll only have PL to focus on and it'll help them gain Europa place.

##Potter:

You don't spend 600 million in a season and then think of sacking the manager whom you actually purchased players for.

1. The squad is too big and players are demotivated cz of uncertainty over future.
2. Too many players kill the squad cohesion.
3. New tactics and it takes time to adjust.
4. Chelsea have scouts and technical directors from Brighton so surely they won't sack the ex Brighton manager. 

##Conte:

Got multiple signings and pretty much players in every position.

1. The Premier League in the last 15 years has been about grabbing the opposition and smashing goals.
2. Conte does the opposite, he feels playing only with solid defensive structure will take his team places while it's pretty outdated in PL.
3.

j9el1dx,117zzp8,dm523,"Rival fan here so you can just call me biased if you want.

I feel that Saka is one of the most physical wingers in the league, he uses his body and legs to shield the ball or win the ball back with plenty of force and I admire him for that. He’s got fantastic strength and it makes sense he should be using it.

That being said, if he invites a physical game then it’s no wonder he gets involved in one. If you don’t go in strong on him he’s going to bully you out of the game so, as expected, defenders come in to challenges with force. Every now and then, like most physical attackers, Saka will let that challenge come in and win the foul, making the player think twice about tackling him next time when maybe he’ll come in physically again, or even just burst right past them.

He uses physicality to give himself the advantage against defenders, so leaving with some bruises is nothing surprising. I can guarantee you he’s leaving plenty of bruises on defenders too.

As far as him getting yellows for his challenges, forwards getting yellows for their first late challenge after being fouled all game is a tale as old as time.

Wingers like Salah, Grealish, Zaha, Hazard etc are all/have been fouled as well - it's been going on for decades really. Getting yellow cards will very much depend on the player doing it and the extent of the foul as well. I think Grealish was fouled much more whilst at Villa because they gave him the ball and he ran at players which drew so many more foul so I wouldn't say it's skin colour at all. 

At the end of the day going out on the pitch your liable to be kicked and hurt - it happens in sport.

Any chance you can link where you found the data to back your argument because it would be interesting to see.

However, what I would also say is that it depends on the type of foul. Not all fouls are equal by any stretch of the imagination and most of the time when I’ve seen Saka getting fouled they’ve been pretty innocuous (but also, again, I’ll caveat this with saying that the same applies to Grealish, Kane, Bernardo Silva, Marcus Rashford, Mo Salah etc. too)

Edit: As of 9/2/2023, Bukayo Saka is the 14th most fouled player in the Premier League, being fouled 34 times.

j9eswdi,117zzp8,kucharssim,"That’s a great point and makes a lot of sense.

That said, it should not matter if a player uses his strength, speed, or tricky dribbling to get past players. If you get fouled, you get fouled and that’s it. 

I agree though that comparing the card:foul ratio for and against him is not the best one. We should look at this ratio across offensive players playing a similar role. I still think we would see a much higher bar for a card to be drawn when Saka is on the receiving end compared to other players (but I don’t have data to back it up so it may be my baised brain deceiving me).",5,r/PremierLeague,Saka and Yellow cards,2023-02-21 12:03:33,0,thats great point make lot sense said matter player u strength speed tricky dribbling get past player get fouled get fouled thats it agree though comparing cardfoul ratio best one look ratio across offensive player playing similar role still think would see much higher bar card drawn saka receiving end compared player but dont data back may baised brain deceiving me

j9f65vu,117zzp8,ray3050,"I get what you’re saying here but physical and holding players off from getting the ball isn’t the same as dangling legs out right? I’d expect a legal physical battle to be shoulder to shoulder, not leaving a leg out or shirt pulling.

I don’t know they just seem like different types of challenges.

I think it always came down more to different players marking saka, so maybe one player might get 4-5 fouls on saka and get 1 yellow. But he’ll get a new marker on him between each foul. It spreads out the fouls over multiple players, some of who get substituted later to avoid more bookings

These kinds of foul tactics aren’t reviewed and it’s taking advantage of the way of reffing is done. It’s nothing new either, just not every player is durable their whole career and some players can survive it.

There’s probably a bit of a factor everywhere but some of the tackles made on saka don’t remind me of a fair physical challenge but more just going to take him down",1,r/PremierLeague,Saka and Yellow cards,2023-02-21 14:07:15,0,get youre saying physical holding player getting ball isnt dangling leg right id expect legal physical battle shoulder shoulder leaving leg shirt pulling dont know seem like different type challenge think always came different player marking saka maybe one player might get 45 foul saka get 1 yellow hell get new marker foul spread foul multiple player get substituted later avoid booking kind foul tactic arent reviewed taking advantage way reffing done nothing new either every player durable whole career player survive it there probably bit factor everywhere tackle made saka dont remind fair physical challenge going take

I don't think it's unfair at all. If the stats show non white players receive a greater than average number of fouls to cards than white players you absolutely can say there could be a problem at an institutional level where referees are consciously or subconsciously treating players differently. 

Do I think every referee is a racist. No. I doubt any or many of them are. But they are pretty uniformly white middle aged men and perhaps they have a subconscious bias that says when a black player goes down they are making a meal of it. Or they tend to give just that little bit of benefit of doubt to somebody who tackles them. 

It's not the same as being I hate black players let's get the injured and rubbing their hands with glee.

Arsenal had more titles than Liverpool in the prem era but seemed to avoid the top side hate. This is coming from someone who’s spent most of his life in the north west tho.

There's far too many variables.

Take Trent Alexander Arnold, who's arguably the best crosser of the ball we've ever seen (a level above even the likes of Beckham and Gerrard in this skill set, in my opinion).

Does that put him at the top of the 'Technically gifted' list? Perhaps it should...as he has an unrivalled ability in the sense that there is nobody his equal when it comes to crossing the ball.

Then you have someone like Haaland who scores goals for fun. Is he 'technically gifted'?   Based on my interpretation of that phrase, I'd say he has major limitations, technically.

Goals win games though, and he's scoring more than his fair share, even if City aren't as effective with him in the team.

Ward-Prowse is a wonderful taker of free-kicks (undoubtedly one of the best around), but this is also his standout attribute and without that, he's a 'ten-a-penny' central midfield player.

Someone mentioned Jack Grealish. I think he's a decent player (obviously massively overpriced) and can draw fouls regularly, but is he really that technically gifted?  I'd say he's got considerable technical ability but not at a similar level to the top wide players such as Mane, Diaz, Saka, Salah, Vinicius Junior etc.

City brought Grealish because he's home-grown AND draws fouls regularly, so although not a brilliant technician, he's got traits that are in-demand.

Rashford doesn't have much technical ability, but he's quick (even if not elite level), which is still a really dangerous attribute, and his finishing has been good of late.  He's more of a confidence player, similar to someone like Darwin Nunez.

When they're playing with confidence, they'll score goals. Look at the Nunez goal last night against Real Madrid. Not many strikers have the technical ability to score there, but you wouldn't really regard him as a great technician in the same mould as Kane, Benzema, Firmino etc.

Ultimately, there doesn't need to be a 'most technically gifted player' as it's completely subjective and that's what makes football, and everyone's opinions on it such a big reason why we love the beautiful game.",13,r/PremierLeague,Who’s the most technically gifted English player around?,2023-02-22 20:02:52,1,this there far many variable take trent alexander arnold who arguably best crosser ball weve ever seen a level even like beckham gerrard skill set opinion put top technically gifted list perhaps shouldas unrivalled ability sense nobody equal come crossing ball someone like haaland score goal fun technically gifted based interpretation phrase id say major limitation technically goal win game though he scoring fair share even city effective team wardprowse wonderful taker freekicks undoubtedly one best around also standout attribute without that he tenapenny central midfield player someone mentioned jack grealish think he decent player obviously massively overpriced draw foul regularly really technically gifted id say he got considerable technical ability similar level top wide player mane diaz saka salah vinicius junior etc city brought grealish he homegrown draw foul regularly although brilliant technician he got trait indemand rashford much technical ability he quick even elite level still really dangerous attribute finishing good late he confidence player similar someone like darwin nunez theyre playing confidence theyll score goal look nunez goal last night real madrid many striker technical ability score there really regard great technician mould kane benzema firmino etc ultimately need most technically gifted player completely subjective thats make football everyones opinion big reason love beautiful game

We won't get into the top 4 just beating teams that we should be beating (ex. Bournemouth), it'll be the games against Man U, Tottenham, and other top 4 challengers.

Our attack looks like it is firing on all cylinders, especially if Firmino and Jota get back to full fitness quick. It's the midfield and defense which is our issue. At no part of today's game or against Newcastle was I confident that our midfield or defense could hold up over 90 minutes. Both Newcastle and Real Madrid basically transitioned and passed through our team with ease, which has been a major problem all season.

Liverpool are slow.

Then looking at the other posts, most covered the KDB topic.  I think he is a big reason Haaland has the goals he does.  KDBs deliveries to him are usually picture perfect, which is needed even more now that Haaland is being sat on pretty much, not a lot of space.
Another big reason, Thierry Henry and Jamie carragher explain in the post match analysis that Haaland rarely comes to space to give them a high percentage pass, he most often goes for a diagonal to the goal.  This starts becoming quite predictable and easier to defend against.  I agree with them and they say it best.  He is a great goal scorer but not a great player/footballer yet.

j9m9rpa,119f2ef,CopiumFC,"That’s not how the DOGSO rule works, though.

There are a number of criteria that they view that kind of a foul against, distance to goal is the first one. We saw a similar situation in the WC where Bale had a wide open net against the US but was in his own half. He was fouled and the US player was given a yellow. Despite the net being open the distance to the goal was too great and a red card wasn’t justified.

Assuming he makes a football play (attempting to get the ball) when bringing him down it’s a cynical foul and a yellow but nothing more when it’s done in the Chelsea attacking half.

We see these exact fouls regularly when players are defending set pieces.

I don’t think Enzo needed to literally drag him down but he started defending him before the player got to the center circle. He could have slid in to take him down while he was still positioned between the attacker and the goal and in the attacking half and “gotten away” with only a yellow. The risk is going down, Adeyemi maneuvering away, and literally being through on goal entirely alone.",-3,r/PremierLeague,Poor showing in UCL round of 16,2023-02-23 00:04:07,1,thats dogso rule work though number criterion view kind foul against distance goal first one saw similar situation wc bale wide open net u half fouled u player given yellow despite net open distance goal great red card wasnt justified assuming make football play attempting get ball bringing cynical foul yellow nothing done chelsea attacking half see exact foul regularly player defending set piece dont think enzo needed literally drag started defending player got center circle could slid take still positioned attacker goal attacking half gotten away yellow risk going down adeyemi maneuvering away literally goal entirely alone

j9gj5y1,118crzr,pillowpotatoes,"haaland is a good fit for any team in the world because he is a generationally great talent.

as a general rule,pep's signings generally take a year to adapt. Remember, cancelo, rodri, mahrez, grealish were considered underwhelming their first years before picking up form their second seasons. Haaland is on pace to break the PL scoring record going through that adaptation period.

If they didn't sign haaland, I would argue that they would still have similar stuggles, since they lost sterling, cancelo, zinchenko, and jesus, and didn't really replace them.

the only thing I noticed is, city likes to play safe and pep doesn't like losing the ball. for the first half of the season, in the big games, they'd much rather pass it around the opponents half than launch a risky ball when haaland makes a run. They've made an effort to find him more, and this was very apparent in the arsenal game. However, that could be because arsenal pressed forward and allowed city the space to find him.

i'd give it a year for city to buy the players to fit around haaland. essentially, city has usually fitted players around their style, but pep is slowly adjusting city's style to fit haaland because he is just that talented.",7,r/PremierLeague,Who thinks Haaland is a good fit for City?,2023-02-21 20:04:37,0,haaland good fit team world generationally great talent general rulepeps signing generally take year adapt remember cancelo rodri mahrez grealish considered underwhelming first year picking form second season haaland pace break pl scoring record going adaptation period sign haaland would argue would still similar stuggles since lost sterling cancelo zinchenko jesus really replace them thing noticed is city like play safe pep like losing ball first half season big game theyd much rather pa around opponent half launch risky ball haaland make run theyve made effort find more apparent arsenal game however could arsenal pressed forward allowed city space find him id give year city buy player fit around haaland essentially city usually fitted player around style pep slowly adjusting city style fit haaland talented

2. Haaland is 1 of the most 1 dimensional players ever, he is only good at shooting, he cant pass and he cant dribble so he contributes nothing to his teammates

It wouldn't be the Saturday, as that's the same day as the Cup Final so police would be an issue.

I live in the area and have a neighbour who works at the council so this sort of thing gets discussed every season. Sunday is generally the favoured day for something like that as the roads are quieter but it's difficult to know what route they would plan on taking.

When we beat Hull and Villa, the buses went from Islington all the way around the area, which was great, but was a massive headache. The parade for the win against Chelsea was cancelled after the Manchester bombings but that route was different, staying mostly within N5 and not going past Highbury Fields.

When we got to the Europa League final in 2019(?) the proposed route was the same, within N5 and it was planned to take place on the Sunday, after the Wednesday final.

j9oa5lq,119uujk,benjhi7,"It does, and if there was an ""any other comments"" box in your questionnaire I would say this:

Some media is good, some journalists and pundits are extremely knowledgeable and well informed. Some are just in it for the controversy and clicks. On the whole, the current state of the media is a net positive for the game: fans have never been so well informed, and in some places (mostly not on Reddit - see the constant  ""who is today's goat?"" Posts on this sub for example) the debate can influence the game itself in a good way.

Obviously the Sky money and the advent of the Premier League has had a massive impact on the way football clubs are run the world over, for better or worse, and the rise of social media has caused the celebrity of good players to transcend the game as a whole, which has a knock on effect on wages, and the exploitation of clubs by players and agents, and indirectly on clubs hiring and firing managers to try and stay relevent in this environment.

On the flip side, going to watch my kid play on a Saturday, or taking in my local Sunday league team is still an enjoyable and cheap experience (the price of football boots these days is ludicrous though), so if you focus on the top, then yes, the effects of coverage saturation and polarised online debate are clear to see, but that has little to no bearing on the game as a whole - at a grassroots level the game is still the game.",2,r/PremierLeague,Has the media killed football?

j9oo18c,119wn5x,Rich-398,"Regarding your comment on Haaland, I have had an internal debate for a while about how much an exceptional striker really helps a team in the long run.  Lukaku at Chelsea was the most recent example of what I am talking about.  While a great striker will single-handedly win games for you, which he did, they also change the team dynamic to the point that if they don't score, no one does and I think their overall benefit can be negative rather than positive.  Haaland has done great at City, but notice that his performance and the team's performance have both dropped off.  Long way to go, but I am fascinated to watch it play out.

BTW - I think Halaand is exceptional.  This isn't about his talent.",1,r/PremierLeague,Question About What Fans Are Really Doing,2023-02-23 14:08:19,0,regarding comment haaland internal debate much exceptional striker really help team long run lukaku chelsea recent example talking about great striker singlehandedly win game you did also change team dynamic point score one think overall benefit negative rather positive haaland done great city notice performance team performance dropped off long way go fascinated watch play out btw think halaand exceptional talent
