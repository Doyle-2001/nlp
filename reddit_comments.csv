j9h6zkw,118h7ej,LostInThought2021,"What an absolutely horrible take. Try to at least disguise your petty bias.

Liverpool have no excuses? How about an aging team that played the most games in Europe last season? Owners that won‚Äôt invest in the team properly for god knows what reason. You talk about Chelsea dealing with a new owner, etc., but Liverpool is dealing with being in limbo because of owners who tried unsuccessfully to sell (and therefore neglected to rebuild the midfield), new attackers trying to get acquainted to both a new team and a new league, and massive changes in the front office including recruiting and the sporting director.

Chelsea have outspent everyone by a wide margin and went out and got every player they could plant their eyes on. They also went and got one of the most promising coaches in the league to manage the team. And where are they? 4 points behind Liverpool, who also have a game in hand on them, and at a 0 for GD for the season (Liverpool are +10). You can say Liverpool have fallen the farthest, and I wouldn‚Äôt disagree, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre having a worse season. And you mentioning Chelsea‚Äôs hopes with new signings is speculative and hasn‚Äôt paid off in the least thus far, so it‚Äôs irrelevant. If Liverpool win their next 2 games (which are games in hand compared to 4 of the top 6 currently), they will be in 6th, behind 5th-place Newcastle only on goal differential. If Chelsea win their next game (which is the one in hand they have compared to 4 of the top 6), they‚Äôll still be 10th.

It's not to say they're having a good season but put it into context - when they had their transfer ban what were peoples views of how they'd perform. Were looking at the spending and automatically assuming that they should win the title. The squad was a mess and to an extent still is - there's a lot needs offloading. Chelsea need to be judged at the end of next season, expectation is they won't qualify for Europe but the fact that they still exist and have built for a future means that post summer there should be a much better what they're about. Strangely all the issues at the minute have reversed, Chelsea defence is a huge strength but they can't score to save their lives. If they start scoring things look a lot better.

To contrast with Liverpool it looks awful as they'd outperformed Expectations to the point that it's become the norm. They'd made an ability to refresh the squad by making marquee sales. The last time they got the final pieces in play to tip them over the edge but the last big sale was Coutinho. They've not had chance to refresh the squad in the way that others have given their methodology. They're paying the price given that they lost one of their most underrated players in mane. I know he was a star but I think people underestimated how much he allowed others to do their thing. Couple that with a midfield that looks woefully outgunned and you're bound to see a huge issue. I'd say that they look like needing at least 2 others to slot in alongside Bellingham if they were to get him, and that looks to be slipping away more each week.

Watching either fall away as far as they did as fast as they did is a shock, to have them both do so....",1,r/PremierLeague,Who‚Äôs having a worse season?

City, while not nearly the most direct team in the PL or Europe, are much much more direct than the Barca of old, because the slow tiki-taka football of old gets eaten up by modern pressing and ""flooding"" of the pitch (Bernardo false LB anyone?) which is also integral to the more tactical teams, including City.

j9kkbt0,118wql6,sleepytoday,"My favourite mental gymnastics to justify a club‚Äôs behaviour was when Derby players Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett drove whilst drunk, and Lawrence crashed the car, breaking the leg of the passenger and team captain Richard Keogh.  The club fined the two drunk drivers 6 weeks‚Äô wages but sacked Keogh (probably just because he was injured).  
  
Many Derby fans at the time felt that the club acted properly.  Apparently Keogh deserved the more severe punishment because he was team captain and should have known better.  Despite the fact that he was the only one who didn‚Äôt drive drunk.  The mental gymnastics to come to that conclusion and actually believe it are quite extraordinary!  
  
Keogh challenged his treatment in court and was eventually awarded ¬£2.4m in damages because it was obvious to anyone with a brain that he was only fired for getting injured, which is not legal in the UK.  And the club couldn‚Äôt even claim it was based on disciplinary, as Lawrence and Bennett had committed worse offences but only received a fine.

Way before my time but have always heard that alongside the 2005 semi final match @ Anfield vs Chelsea, that that was the best atmosphere anfield has ever had. 

Last there‚Äôs some definite fondness with Celtic. YNWA connection, Irish connection, anti Monarchy/Tory connection, left wing, you name it. Also King Kenny and the fact they were one of the first ones to reach out after Hillsborough goes a LONG way. 

Remember stumbling across a vid of the [Charity Match](https://youtu.be/UF0LQ-UlwaM) @ Celtic Park. Beautiful beautiful scenes after such a tragic event

I do feel like we are jumping the gun a lot with the rhetoric around some Arsenal players at the moment. In all likelihood they will get to those levels, but it feels pretty premature to be putting them in the same boat as the best of the very best today.

j9nt6ko,119fa8a,ravenouscartoon,"Playing the ball early into space for a striker like Haaland is the opposite of everything Pep coaches. It risks losing possession, and even worse, if you do not early (like Haaland thrives on) you‚Äôre not set up in your rest defence shapes, so can be vulnerable to counters. 

Haaland is a bad fit unless Pep changes his tactics slightly. I think he‚Äôs a good enough coach to do it, but whether he wants to or not is another matter.

j9ov6g1,119fa8a,PabloRothko,"Peps tactics. They score goals but peps first priority is defense by having control over games. He likes his teams to limit mistakes, and playing through balls to haaland all the time would disrupt this. 

Pep is one of the most defensive managers, it‚Äôs just his teams also score a lot of goals, so it‚Äôs not that noticeable. The goals he likes his teams to score usually come from high percentage chances in the box or cut backs in to the box. If they lose the ball in those positions, it isn‚Äôt as dangerous as trying a random through ball and being open to the counter.

With these tactics, and city basically never counter attacking because they always have control, I see Haaland getting frustrated soon.

Then looking at the other posts, most covered the KDB topic.  I think he is a big reason Haaland has the goals he does.  KDBs deliveries to him are usually picture perfect, which is needed even more now that Haaland is being sat on pretty much, not a lot of space.
Another big reason, Thierry Henry and Jamie carragher explain in the post match analysis that Haaland rarely comes to space to give them a high percentage pass, he most often goes for a diagonal to the goal.  This starts becoming quite predictable and easier to defend against.  I agree with them and they say it best.  He is a great goal scorer but not a great player/footballer yet.  He needs to make himself more available according to the guys he is on the field with.

There are a number of criteria that they view that kind of a foul against, distance to goal is the first one. We saw a similar situation in the WC where Bale had a wide open net against the US but was in his own half. He was fouled and the US player was given a yellow. Despite the net being open the distance to the goal was too great and a red card wasn‚Äôt justified.

Assuming he makes a football play (attempting to get the ball) when bringing him down it‚Äôs a cynical foul and a yellow but nothing more when it‚Äôs done in the Chelsea attacking half.

We see these exact fouls regularly when players are defending set pieces.

I don‚Äôt think Enzo needed to literally drag him down but he started defending him before the player got to the center circle. He could have slid in to take him down while he was still positioned between the attacker and the goal and in the attacking half and ‚Äúgotten away‚Äù with only a yellow.

So looking at Haaland he is scoring goals at the fastest rate ever seen in the PL (although only a half a season so far), but he doesn't offer much to the team when he doesn't have the ball like pressing or getting back to help on defence. So you might ask why would take the best scorer out of the team? Well Man City were one of the highest scoring teams in world football without him over the last 5 years but are doing worse overall this season with him in the team. Man city are worse defensively now than they have been in the past. Man city's problems are more complicated than just the amount of goals scored. The pundits were probably suggesting a player who presses more and helps more put on defence would help city more because they need more help defensively. Relating this to your question about fans, if you are just looking at stats then it wouldn't really explain man city's poor (by their standards) performances this season.

j9ph7pt,119wn5x,QuestionableMotiv,"I think that‚Äôs true outside of Reddit. I get a strong sense lots of people don‚Äôt actually watch games.

For example. Liverpool have had lots of injuries, come off the back of a devastatingly close run last year. Lost a key player, several players are clearly past their best. But you rarely see all that discussed. 

City have had some issues with injuries, pep has said they lacked motivation. Coming off several close battles with Liverpool over 5 years. And yet it‚Äôs all haalands fault, peps fault for playing him etc.

j9p94zo,119wn5x,StarboyFactor,"With the NBA, if you know for sure your team is making the playoffs or not then the regular season doesn‚Äôt really matter and it‚Äôs easier to just check the scores and stats. The stats also give a pretty fair representation of what happened in the game. 

In football, every game does matter and stats don‚Äôt tell the whole story so fans typically watch the full match. You‚Äôll definitely get more informed opinions from fans on their own clubs as they‚Äôre more up to date with team news and they probably also watch player interviews, training sessions, etc. Neutrals may not have the best opinions but honestly, some things like City changing their system to fit Haaland is pretty obvious even for non-City fans.",1,r/PremierLeague,Question About What Fans Are Really Doing,2023-02-23 16:32:21,0,nba know sure team making playoff regular season doesnt really matter easier check score stats stats also give pretty fair representation happened game football every game matter stats dont tell whole story fan typically watch full match youll definitely get informed opinion fan club theyre date team news probably also watch player interview training session etc neutral may best opinion honestly thing like city changing system fit haaland pretty obvious even noncity fan
